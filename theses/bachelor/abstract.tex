Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) corrections at next-to-leading order (NLO) are an essential component of high-precision theoretical predictions in high-energy particle physics. The nested soft-collinear subtraction (NSC) scheme provides an established framework for computing these corrections, offering an efficient method for handling infrared (IR) divergences through a nested factorization of soft and collinear singularities. This approach ensures proper cancellation of divergences.
In this work, we focus on hadronic scattering processes and we extend the NSC framework by implementing $\theta$-parameters, which systematically restrict the subtraction procedure to the singular, unresolved regions of phase space. This refinement is designed to further enhance the scheme's numerical stability and computational efficiency by optimizing the treatment of IR-sensitive contributions.
